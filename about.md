## About Me

I’m a **Backend Developer** with a Bachelor’s Degree in **Computer Science** from [Fayoum University](https://www.fayoum.edu.eg/), where I graduated in **June 2022**. I have completed advanced coursework in **Full-Stack Web Development** through [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), mastering technologies like **TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL**. I am passionate about building scalable and efficient web applications, with a focus on **backend development** and **cloud-native technologies**.

I worked on several projects, including a [**Spyware Detector**](https://github.com/ahmed-n-abdeltwab/spyware-detector), where I developed a backend web service using **Flask** that achieved a **96.3% detection rate** for spyware files with a **false positive rate of <3.6%**. I also built a [**real-time Chat App**](https://github.com/ahmed-n-abdeltwab/chat) using **TypeScript, WebSocket, and Express.js**, improving error handling by **30%** through a custom error handling mechanism. During my internship at **NDM**, I implemented a **Django API** and frontend for a company project, resulting in a **25% increase in efficiency** and a **30% reduction in errors**.

My technical expertise includes **JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and C++**, and I am proficient in tools like **Docker, CI/CD (CircleCI, GitHub Actions), and PostgreSQL**. I have also worked with **AWS (Elastic Beanstalk)** and **Kubernetes** for deploying and managing applications.

My interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **backend development**, and **cloud-native technologies**. I am particularly fascinated by the challenges of building scalable, efficient, and secure systems. I am also exploring **AI tools** and their applications in solving real-world problems.

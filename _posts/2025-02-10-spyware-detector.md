## **🚀 Building a Spyware Detection System: Refactoring & Lessons Learned**

## **Introduction**

Over the past few weeks, I have been working on refactoring and improving a **spyware detection system** written in Node.js. The goal was to enhance **performance, security, and maintainability** while making the project more scalable and easier to contribute to. This blog details what I’ve done so far, key takeaways, and what’s next for the project.

## **1️⃣ What I Did: Refactoring & Enhancements**

### **📌 Code Restructuring & Cleanup**

- Reorganized the project structure for better maintainability.
- Separated concerns using a **modular design** (services, controllers, and routes).
- Improved **error handling** and added centralized logging with **Winston**.

### **🛡️ Security & Performance Improvements**

- Enhanced input validation with **Express Validator** to prevent malicious inputs.
- Strengthened API security by implementing **JWT authentication**.
- Optimized file handling using **streaming and buffering techniques** for better performance.

### **🐳 Docker & Deployment Enhancements**

- Improved **Dockerfile** for optimized image sizes.
- Configured **Docker Compose** for seamless local development and deployment.
- Ensured **environment variable management** using **Dotenv**.

### **🔍 Logging & Monitoring**

- Set up **structured logging** with Winston for better debugging.
- Added request logging with **Morgan**.
- Prepared to integrate **Prometheus & Grafana** for monitoring.

## **2️⃣ Challenges & How I Solved Them**

| Challenge                       | Solution                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unstructured codebase**       | Refactored into **modular components** for better maintainability. |
| **Inefficient file handling**   | Implemented **streaming uploads** for memory efficiency.           |
| **API security risks**          | Strengthened **input validation & authentication** mechanisms.     |
| **Logging lacked clarity**      | Integrated **Winston & Morgan** for better debugging.              |
| **Docker image size too large** | Optimized Dockerfile for **smaller, efficient builds**.            |

# **üöÄ Building a Real-Time Virus Scanning System Using ML: Lessons Learned**  

## **Introduction**  
In this blog, we‚Äôll walk through our journey of designing and developing a **real-time, scalable virus scanning system** that leverages **machine learning (ML)** to detect malware. We‚Äôll cover key challenges, solutions, and what we‚Äôve learned along the way.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Problem**  
Traditional virus scanning methods rely on **signature-based detection**, which can be bypassed by advanced threats. Our goal was to design a **modern, scalable** system that:  
‚úÖ **Allows users to upload files** for scanning.  
‚úÖ **Uses multiple virus scanners** along with an ML model.  
‚úÖ **Supports real-time analysis** while handling large-scale traffic.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Designing the Architecture**  
### **üìå Key Components**
- **API Gateway**: Manages authentication and routes requests.  
- **File Storage**: Temporarily holds uploaded files.  
- **Scanning Service**: Runs virus scans in an **isolated environment** (VMs, Docker).  
- **ML Engine**: Detects malware using **file behavior analysis**.  
- **Result Processing**: Aggregates scan reports and stores them in a database.  
- **Monitoring & Security**: Logs system activity and ensures reliability.  

### **üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: TypeScript (Node.js + Express)  
- **ML Model**: Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Storage**: S3-compatible cloud storage  
- **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, sandboxing

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges and How We Solved Them**  
| Challenge                                         | Solution                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Isolating the scanning process**                | Used Docker & VMs for sandboxed execution.                           |
| **Handling large files (50KB ‚Äì 2GB)**             | Implemented **streaming uploads** and **chunk-based processing**.    |
| **Scalability for millions of users**             | Designed a **distributed system** using **asynchronous processing**. |
| **Ensuring security**                             | Implemented **rate limiting, access control, and monitoring**.       |

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways**  
### **üîë Key Insight:**  
**_"Building a real-time, scalable virus scanning system requires a secure, isolated environment for processing untrusted files, leveraging asynchronous and distributed architectures to handle large-scale traffic efficiently, while integrating ML models to enhance threat detection beyond traditional signature-based methods."_**  

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**  
üéØ **Enhancements We Plan to Add:**  
‚úÖ **Threat intelligence integration** (real-time updates from external sources).  
‚úÖ **Better ML models** with improved accuracy.  
‚úÖ **Auto-sandboxing for unknown threats**.

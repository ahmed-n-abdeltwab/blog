## Designing a URL Shortener Database Backend

## Introduction

Imagine your URL shortener gets hacked because attackers easily guess sequential short URLs, scanning your entire database. This lecture tackles **designing a secure, scalable database backend** for a URL shortener. We compare two approaches—**auto-incrementing IDs** vs. **hashed/custom URLs**—and discuss scaling strategies. The key revelation? _Simplicity and scalability often clash; the right design depends on your use case._

## Core Concepts

### Design 1: Auto-incrementing IDs

- **Structure**: A relational table with `ID` (primary key, 64-bit serial) and `Long URL`.
- **Workflow**:
  - **Shorten**: Insert `Long URL`, return `ID` (e.g., `domain.com/7`).
  - **Redirect**: Query by `ID` (fast due to indexed integer).
- **Pros**:
  - ⚡ **Blazing-fast reads/writes** (indexed integer lookups).
  - 🛠️ **No collision risk** (unique IDs guaranteed).
- **Cons**:
  - 🔍 **Predictable URLs**: Attackers can scan IDs to harvest URLs.
  - 🚫 **No custom URLs**.

### Design 2: Hashed/Custom URLs

- **Structure**: Table with `Short URL` (primary key, 8-character hash) and `Long URL`.
- **Workflow**:
  - **Shorten**: Hash the `Long URL` (e.g., SHA-256 + base64), insert. On collision, retry with a salt.
  - **Redirect**: Query by `Short URL` (indexed but slower than integers).
- **Pros**:
  - 🔒 **Unpredictable URLs**: Mitigates scanning attacks.
  - 🎨 **Supports custom URLs** (user-defined short paths).
- **Cons**:
  - 🐢 **Slower writes**: Collision handling adds retries.
  - 💾 **Larger indexes**: Strings vs. integers.

## Scaling Strategies

### Replication & Read Replicas

- **Master Database**: Handles **all writes** (e.g., creating short URLs).
- **Read Replicas**:
  - Deploy globally to serve **GET requests** (redirects).
  - Reduce load on the master and improve read latency for users.
  - _Trade-off_: **Eventual consistency**—replicas may lag behind the master by milliseconds.

### Reverse Proxy (Layer 7 Load Balancer)

- **Role**:
  - Routes **POST requests** (writes) to the master database.
  - Directs **GET requests** (reads) to the nearest read replica.
- **Geographical Distribution**:
  - Place proxies in regions (e.g., Asia, Europe) to minimize latency.
  - Example: A user in Europe accesses a European replica, while writes go to a master in North America.

### Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning)

- **When to Use**: Only if the **master database cannot handle write volume**.
- **Approach**:
  - Split data by a shard key (e.g., `Short URL` prefix or geographic region).
  - Each shard operates independently, reducing write congestion.
- _Trade-off_: **Complexity**—joins and global queries become harder.

## Key Characteristics

- **Indexing**:
  - Design 1 uses a compact **integer index**; Design 2 uses a **string index** (larger but secure).
- **Collision Handling**:
  - Design 2 requires **salting** and retries on insertion conflicts.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

| **Aspect**        | Design 1 (Auto-ID)      | Design 2 (Hashed/Custom)          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Speed**         | Faster reads/writes     | Slower writes (collision retries) |
| **Security**      | Predictable, vulnerable | Secure, unpredictable             |
| **Customization** | No custom URLs          | Supports custom URLs              |
| **Scalability**   | Easier to scale reads   | Same as Design 1 + sharding       |

## Practical Implementations

1. **Database Setup**:

   ```sql
   -- Design 1
   CREATE TABLE short_urls (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     long_url TEXT NOT NULL
   );

   -- Design 2
   CREATE TABLE custom_urls (
     short_url VARCHAR(8) PRIMARY KEY,
     long_url TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Scaling Infrastructure**:
   - Use **PostgreSQL or MySQL** for replication (supports built-in read replicas).
   - Configure a **reverse proxy** (e.g., NGINX) to route traffic.
3. **Redirect Logic**:
   - Use HTTP `301` (permanent) or `302` (temporary) redirects after querying the database.

## Conclusion

- **Choose Design 1** for internal systems where speed matters and URLs aren’t user-facing.
- **Choose Design 2** for public services (e.g., Bitly) requiring security and custom URLs.
- **Scaling Takeaway**:
  - Start with **replication** for reads.
  - Use a **reverse proxy** to manage traffic.
  - **Shard** only when writes overwhelm the master.

## Designing a Twitter-like System

## Introduction

**Pain Point:** Building a social media platform like Twitter requires balancing scalability, reliability, and user experience. How do you handle millions of tweets, follows, and timeline updates without crashing?

**Key Revelation:** _There’s no perfect system design—only trade-offs._ The lecture emphasizes pragmatic choices over chasing "shiny" technologies. For example, Twitter’s early struggles with the "Fail Whale" outage highlight the importance of resilient architecture.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Posting a Tweet

- **Authentication:** Verify user identity before allowing tweets.
- **Database Storage:** Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.
- **Reliability:** Introduce a **message queue** (e.g., Kafka) to decouple client requests from database writes.
  > "If the database fails, the queue persists the tweet for later processing, ensuring no data loss."

### 2. Following Users

- **Database Design:**

  - **`profiles` table:** Stores user IDs, names, bios.
  - **`follows` table:** Maps relationships (`source_id` → `target_id`).
  - **Indexing:** Use multi-column indexes for fast lookups.

- **Query Optimization & Trade-offs:**
  The `follows` table enables two critical queries:

  1. Who does user X follow? → `SELECT target_id FROM follows WHERE source_id = X`
  2. Who follows user X? → `SELECT source_id FROM follows WHERE target_id = X`

  Without indexes, both queries require full table scans (**O(n)** time complexity), which doesn't scale.
  With indexes on `source_id` and `target_id`, the database uses **B-tree lookups** (**O(log n)**), greatly improving performance on large datasets.

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_source ON follows(source_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_target ON follows(target_id);
  ```

  To prevent duplicates (e.g., user X follows Y more than once), add a **composite unique constraint**:

  ```sql
  UNIQUE (source_id, target_id)
  ```

- **Hardware Considerations:**

  | **Factor**   | **Impact**                                                                  |
  | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **RAM**      | Caching index pages speeds up queries dramatically.                         |
  | **Disk I/O** | Full scans hurt performance on HDDs; SSDs mitigate this.                    |
  | **CPU**      | Unindexed queries use more CPU for filtering and sorting.                   |
  | **Storage**  | Indexes require additional space (\~20–30% of table size) but are worth it. |

- **Scalability Tips:**

  - Add foreign key constraints for data integrity:

    ```sql
    FOREIGN KEY (source_id) REFERENCES profiles(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (target_id) REFERENCES profiles(id)
    ```

  - Consider **sharding or partitioning** by user ID when the table reaches tens of millions of rows.
  - Use **Redis** to cache follower counts or frequently accessed relationships.

### 3. Timeline Generation

- **Home Timeline:** Aggregates tweets from followed users.
- **Performance:** Avoid real-time computation by pre-computing timelines (not covered in depth here).

## Key Characteristics

### Trade-offs in System Design

| **Choice**                     | **Pros**                           | **Cons**                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Message Queue**              | Improves reliability, async writes | Adds complexity, new infra to manage  |
| **Client-Side Load Balancing** | Reduces server load                | Hard to manage blue/green deployments |
| **HTTP/2**                     | Fewer TCP connections, faster      | CPU-intensive, harder to debug        |

### Handling Failures

- **Client-Side Storage:** Use SQLite to save drafts if posting fails.
- **Retry Logic:** Implement retries at the server or message queue level.

## Practical Implementations

### Load Balancing Strategies

1. **Layer 7 (Reverse Proxy):**
   - Routes HTTP requests to backend servers.
   - Requires TLS termination and connection pooling.
2. **Client-Side Balancing:**
   - Clients fetch a server list and connect directly.
   - _Insight:_ Netflix uses this to avoid proxy bottlenecks.

### Database Scaling

- **Sharding:** Split data by user ID or region.
- **Caching:** Add Redis/Memcached for frequent queries (e.g., follower counts).

## Conclusion

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with a monolithic architecture (relational DB + REST API) and scale as needed.
2. **Embrace Trade-offs:** Choose reliability (message queues) over low latency when necessary.
3. **Focus on Fundamentals:** Protocols (HTTP/2), indexing, and efficient queries matter more than trendy tools.

# Designing a Twitter-like System

## Introduction
**Pain Point:** Building a social media platform like Twitter requires balancing scalability, reliability, and user experience. How do you handle millions of tweets, follows, and timeline updates without crashing?  

**Key Revelation:** *There’s no perfect system design—only trade-offs.* The lecture emphasizes pragmatic choices over chasing "shiny" technologies. For example, Twitter’s early struggles with the "Fail Whale" outage highlight the importance of resilient architecture.

## Core Concepts
### 1. Posting a Tweet
- **Authentication:** Verify user identity before allowing tweets.
- **Database Storage:** Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.  
- **Reliability:** Introduce a **message queue** (e.g., Kafka) to decouple client requests from database writes.  
  > "If the database fails, the queue persists the tweet for later processing, ensuring no data loss."  

### 2. Following Users
- **Database Design:**  
  - **`profiles` table:** Stores user IDs, names, bios.  
  - **`follows` table:** Maps relationships (`source_id` → `target_id`).  
  - **Indexing:** Use multi-column indexes for fast lookups.  
- **Query Challenges:**  
  - Counting followers/following requires efficient `COUNT` operations.  
  - Displaying follower names may involve costly joins or denormalization (storing names in the `follows` table).  

### 3. Timeline Generation
- **Home Timeline:** Aggregates tweets from followed users.  
- **Performance:** Avoid real-time computation by pre-computing timelines (not covered in depth here).

## Key Characteristics
### Trade-offs in System Design

| **Choice**                | **Pros**                          | **Cons**                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Message Queue**          | Improves reliability, async writes | Adds complexity, new infra to manage |
| **Client-Side Load Balancing** | Reduces server load            | Hard to manage blue/green deployments |
| **HTTP/2**                | Fewer TCP connections, faster     | CPU-intensive, harder to debug    |

### Handling Failures
- **Client-Side Storage:** Use SQLite to save drafts if posting fails.  
- **Retry Logic:** Implement retries at the server or message queue level.

## Practical Implementations
### Load Balancing Strategies
1. **Layer 7 (Reverse Proxy):**  
   - Routes HTTP requests to backend servers.  
   - Requires TLS termination and connection pooling.  
2. **Client-Side Balancing:**  
   - Clients fetch a server list and connect directly.  
   - *Insight:* Netflix uses this to avoid proxy bottlenecks.  

### Database Scaling
- **Sharding:** Split data by user ID or region.  
- **Caching:** Add Redis/Memcached for frequent queries (e.g., follower counts).

## Conclusion
1. **Start Simple:** Begin with a monolithic architecture (relational DB + REST API) and scale as needed.  
2. **Embrace Trade-offs:** Choose reliability (message queues) over low latency when necessary.  
3. **Focus on Fundamentals:** Protocols (HTTP/2), indexing, and efficient queries matter more than trendy tools.

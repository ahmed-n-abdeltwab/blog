## **Building a Real-Time Virus Scanning System Using ML: Lessons Learned**

## **Introduction**

In this blog, we’ll walk through our journey of designing and developing a **real-time, scalable virus scanning system** that leverages **machine learning (ML)** to detect malware. We’ll cover key challenges, solutions, and what we’ve learned along the way.

## **Understanding the Problem**

Traditional virus scanning methods rely on **signature-based detection**, which can be bypassed by advanced threats. Our goal was to design a **modern, scalable** system that:  
* **Allows users to upload files** for scanning.  
* **Uses multiple virus scanners** along with an ML model.  
* **Supports real-time analysis** while handling large-scale traffic.

## **Designing the Architecture**

### **Key Components**

- **API Gateway**: Manages authentication and routes requests.
- **File Storage**: Temporarily holds uploaded files.
- **Scanning Service**: Runs virus scans in an **isolated environment** (VMs, Docker).
- **ML Engine**: Detects malware using **file behavior analysis**.
- **Result Processing**: Aggregates scan reports and stores them in a database.
- **Monitoring & Security**: Logs system activity and ensures reliability.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: TypeScript (Node.js + Express)
- **ML Model**: Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Storage**: S3-compatible cloud storage
- **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, sandboxing

## **Challenges and How We Solved Them**

|               Challenge               |                               Solution                               |
| :-----------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  **Isolating the scanning process**   |              Used Docker & VMs for sandboxed execution.              |
| **Handling large files (50KB – 2GB)** |  Implemented **streaming uploads** and **chunk-based processing**.   |
| **Scalability for millions of users** | Designed a **distributed system** using **asynchronous processing**. |
|         **Ensuring security**         |    Implemented **rate limiting, access control, and monitoring**.    |

## **Key Takeaways**

### **Key Insight:**

**_"Building a real-time, scalable virus scanning system requires a secure, isolated environment for processing untrusted files, leveraging asynchronous and distributed architectures to handle large-scale traffic efficiently, while integrating ML models to enhance threat detection beyond traditional signature-based methods."_**

## **Next Steps**

**Enhancements We Plan to Add:**  
* **Threat intelligence integration** (real-time updates from external sources).  
* **Better ML models** with improved accuracy.  
* **Auto-sandboxing for unknown threats**.
